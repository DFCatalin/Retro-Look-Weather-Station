# Retro-Look-Weather-Station

This project is a first version of a mesh sensor network using ESP32 stations which communicates using ESP-NOW.
The modules are sampling temperature, air pressure and light illuminance using low power, I2C interface sensors.

The master station has a 10 digit VFD drived by Microchip HV5812 IC.
